# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Kevin Grimes

## Overview.
. . . . . . A statement of the app concept and objectives. For an expansion of the Movies Fan app, only state the additional objectives  . . . . . 


 . . . . . List of user features. For extension to the Movies Fan app, only list new/modified features) . . . . 
 
 + Feature 1
 + Feature 2
 + Feature 3
 + etc
 + etc

## Setup requirements.

Server application repo: https://github.com/kevingrimestramore/ewd2020assignment2

. . . . Briefly state (to a third party) the setup steps necessary to run your app/client. [You need only reference the server-side repo's URL for completeness - its README will detail server-side initialization requirements.]

## Data Model Design.

[Custom app only]
 Diagram of app's data model (see example below) AND/OR a sample of the test data used (JSON or equivalent).

![][model]

[Movies Fan app extension only]
Specify the additional TMDB endpoints used and show sample responses, in JSON.

## App Design.

### Component catalogue.

 . . . . A screenshot showing the component stories from the Storybook UI. For expansion to the Movies app, hi-light stories relating to new/modified components.

![][stories]

### Design patterns.

..... Briefly state the application of any composition design pattern (i.e. Render props, Container) in your codebase. Distinguish between those relating to the reuse of patterns already implemented in the labs (e.g. TemplateMoviePage) and new occurrences. Code excerpts art NOT necessary.

## UI Design.

. . . . . Screenshots of app's views (see example below) with appropriate captions (For extension to the Movies Fan App, only show the new/modified views) . . . . . . . 

![][view]
